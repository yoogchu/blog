I’m majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Aerospace Engineer. Looking down the road, I hope to do meaningful work with artificial intelligence. Humans are prone to error. Humans crack under pressure. By implementing artificial intelligence into various aspects of daily life, I believe that overall quality of life can be increased.<br>In my free time, I have a passion for rock climbing, specifically bouldering. I appreciate and enjoy the duality of challenges that it presents me: physically and mentally. Seeking and solving routes through creative solutions and then implementing those solutions with hard work and determination provides me with extraordinary satisfaction.<br>I also enjoy skateboarding, mostly for the thrill of speeding down hills at 15-20 mph. Knowing that a break in concentration - or even luck, really, will end up in a trip to the hospital. I’m not sure why I risk my life so precariously, but if I were to guess, I would venture that I enjoy the control over I have over my life in those few moments in a world where so much is left up to chance.<br>If I had to choose, I would say my passion is learning. If I had to attribute my switch in majors (5 semesters in) to anything, it would be due to computer science being so readily available to learn. There’s just so much available information out there, that makes learning topics on sorting, machine intelligence, whatever, infinitely more accessible compared to aerospace engineering.</p>
