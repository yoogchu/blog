                <p>When I first started this blog, I sought to become a better storyteller. So perhaps instead of my usual way of talking, I’m going to try narrating my experience for the night of 6/14/17. <hr> I tumbled towards the floor, my fingers narrowly slipping off the unforgiving plastic. The soft, not-entirely-soft mat met me with a resounding thud. I fell once again. Glancing up, the move was kind of ridiculous, I must admit. The crux consisted of a one-handed dino only to met with a stubborn sloper. A laugh. I turn around, and a smile. <br><br><blockquote><p>Thats a big move. </p>
</blockquote><br>I flash a smile back, “yeah.. yeah it is, I suppose.” <hr><br>// WOW OK this is totally starting to sound like fanfic but i swear it wasnt intended to <br> &lt;&lt; fast forward &gt;&gt; <hr><br>I mentally prep, grit my teeth, stick the move, and finish the problem. I fall off, a little more gracefully this time, with the confidence of someone who knows that he’s done something impressive. You’re sitting there, studying the wall, looking right, and I steel myself. <br></p>
<p>Small talk goes a long way, I think, into exposing someone’s personality. It’s just courtesy, of course, but the <i>mannerisms</i>, and the delivery, I think, are a good reflection of one’s character. I leveraged climbing as a means of entry to conversation, and it worked. <hr> &lt;&lt; fast forward to fire alarm going off while im mid-route &gt;&gt; <hr> Amongst everyone heading towards the exit stood an lonely boy, given a taste of meaningful conversation, longing for more. <br><br><blockquote><p>Do you want a ride back to DC? I was going to head up there anyways to take some pictures. </p>
</blockquote> <br> // not the worst line, i suppose, but… <br> Okay so. Diverging from the narrative a little: I hate describing people and I hate when people try to describe themselves. A person, a life, is <strong>SO</strong> much more than just a few adjectives, several hobbies, an education. <hr></p>
<p>You: Frankie. LA. PhD candidate in aerospace engineering. Cornell undergrad. Cornell grad. NASA. Goddard. JPL. The list goes on. I was impressed, but more so because you turned out so socially <i>normal</i>. Frankie, if you ever read this, you’re what I wanted to be when I stepped into Georgia Tech. You resemble the part of me that yearned to do scientific good, to not sell out to computer science. The part of me that kept my wildest dreams alive for 2+ years. I like to think that if I had met current you, during my moment of indecision, maybe you could’ve swayed my mind into staying aerospace. The things you talked about that you do at JPL… <i>man</i>. I don’t know. I barely know you, but I look up to you tremendously. Honestly. You’re an inspiration to my engineering facet. <br><br> Ok. Ok. Besides the aerospace stuff, I actually really enjoyed talking with you. This post speaks for itself, I suppose. <hr> I’ve always considered myself a dreamer. Most people don’t see it, hardly anyone actually sees it. I’m self aware. When they look at me, they don’t see me, they don’t see my passion or dreams; they see the persona I’m comfortable with putting on: the culmination of years of ‘rolling with the punches’, so to speak. But throughout the night, I never felt like I had to resort to that. Growing up has made me hard, and I don’t really talk about my dreams, or vision with people I don’t entirely trust. Others, they laugh, they call me stupid for even dreaming. Why? Why? Why live if you’re not going to dream big? What are you even living for? I disgress. You didn’t laugh. And you took me seriously – and I am so, <i>so</i> grateful for that. <hr>Out of all the chance encounters I’ve had in my life, this one night was probably the most significant. You pondered what makes a moment significant – I don’t know what to tell you. Perhaps it can’t be quantified; perhaps it’s one of those things that you just <i>know</i>. Hm. Ah. Yes. My initial inspiration for this post was because I was thinking about this conversation and I realized that I want to be what you were to me, Frankie. I want to be significant, if perhaps only fleeting, in someone else’s story. I want to be remembered. To be inspiring, just by being. You didn’t even try – that’s the thing. Just by being you, you inspired me. Thank you, thank you for that night. </p>
